# ngrx-micro-frontend
This is a library for using NgRx to manage state for self-contained apps in a Micro-Frontend architecture. Each self-contained isolated app can have its own isolated and decoupled NgRx store. The componentized stores interact with a global store for enabling cross-application communication.
